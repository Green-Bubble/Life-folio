## Instructions:

### Step 1 - Setting up Header

By befault the header element would be displaying "(Lif)E - portfolio of Your Name".\
To replace "your Name" with expected text, Go to `src\data\constants.tsx` and under the Constants change value of USERNAME with expected text.

```javascript
export enum Constants {
  USERNAME = "Your Name",
}
```

### Step 2 - Setting up Footer

Go to `src\data\Contact.json` and provide the required contact infomation data in the respective fields

```javascript
{
  "emailId": "userName@gmail.com",
  "linkedIn": "https://www.linkedin.com/",
  "twitter": "https://twitter.com/home",
  "github": "https://github.com/"
}
```

### Step 3 - Setting up sections

Go to `src\data\sections.json`, this file contains list of the Life-folio sections for which the informations can be set.\
To Disable any section as per requirement, the hide property have be set to true.\
For example if, Projects sections is to be disabled

```javascript
{
  "name": "Projects",
  "key": "projects",
  "hide": true
}
```

### Step 4 - Setting up the data of sections

Under `src\data`, you will find multiple json files named `AboutMe.json`, `Experience.json`, `Education.json`, `Projects.json`, `Skills.json` and `Certifications.json`.\
Each respective to About Me, Experience, Education, Projects, Skills and Certification sections of the Life-folio.

#### AboutMe.json

Fill in the json with your date.

```javascript
{
  "aboutMe": ""
}
```

**_Note_**: To replace the image and resume in About me section with your image own image and resume, under `src\assets` replace the `pic.png` and `resume.pdf` file.

#### Experience.json

Fill in the json with your date.

```javascript
[
  {
    span: "Year Month -  current",
    company: "",

    progress: [
      {
        role: "Role Name",
        span: "Year Month - Current",

**_Note_**: To add the image of companies you have been employed with in the Employment section, place those files under `src\assets` folder, following the naming convenstion such that `<company-name>.<format>`. Then in the `src\data\constants.tsx` file, import the added files and map them accordingly with company name.

Example, if company name is Google
